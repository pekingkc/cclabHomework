It’s a audioViz work. My goal is to find voice’s visual beauty.

My visual effect based on a example downloaded from a website. There’s book about learning oF. And they provide the code for download. I download the code from here,
https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/support

I use the “ParticlesEmitter”example in “Particles”. The example looks different from my work. You can download my reference code here,

For the sound input, I just learn from the example in oF documents. The location is here,
examples/sound/audioInputExample
So I know how to setup audioInput function and how to use it.

For fulfilling my work, I learn how to use“argument” from my classmate in 2nd year. So I can get sound input and easily put them into the code, which part is for drawing particle.
