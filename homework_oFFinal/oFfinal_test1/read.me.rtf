\f0\fs24 \cf0 It\'a1\'afs a audioViz work. My goal is to find voice\'a1\'afs visual beauty.\
\
My visual effect based on an example downloaded from a website. There\'a1\'afs book about learning oF. And they provide the code for download. I download the code from here,\
https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/support\
\
I use the \'a1\'b0ParticlesEmitter\'a1\'b1example in \'a1\'b0Particles\'a1\'b1. The example looks different from my work. You can download my reference code here,\
https://app.box.com/s/lkco806qep1hn358pr7x\
\
For the sound input, I just learn from the example in oF documents. The location is here,\
examples/sound/audioInputExample\
So I know how to setup audioInput function and how to use it.\
\
For fulfilling my work, I learn how to use\'a1\'b0argument\'a1\'b1 from my classmate in 2nd year. So I can easily put the value getting from audio input into the code, for drawing visual stuff.}
