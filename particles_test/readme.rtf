\f0\fs24 \cf0 I love light graffiti. When I saw the Graffiti Analysis project (http://graffitianalysis.com/how-to/) by Evan Roth, I thought I must try this some day.\
\
When I looked up through the examples, I found \'a1\'b0cameraRibbonExample\'a1\'b1in 3D, and \'a1\'b0particlesExample\'a1\'b1 in Math. I was so excited! So I combined these two together.\
I can experience a new way to graffiti, even new than light graffiti. \
\
I changed the color and thickness of the \'a1\'b0brush\'a1\'b1. \
When I added the particle example to the ribbon example, I changed the color of the particle. \
I also changed the size, the speed of the particles.\
\
But when I changed the file\'a1\'afs location, the file can not work. I think I have to keep the file in \'a1\'b0examples<math\'a1\'b1, so as to launch it.\
